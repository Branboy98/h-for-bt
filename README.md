Repo for integration with Heroku
Based on the Heroku tutorial app 'Getting Started 
with Python'.
But no longer connected with the tutorial repo, 
    because that repo is read-only to the public (us).

Bill has hacked views.py to deliver a payload that
is a simple AFrame example.  This is just a 
proof-of-concept. That payload was created 
by iFp.

The next step will be to make a fresh Django/Python
repo to hold 'Tools for Curiousity' as a Django app.
TBD: how to organize features, like 'Mini Game 4',
and also developer's isolated work areas.

This may be just branches in Git, or a combination
of branches and Django apps.
